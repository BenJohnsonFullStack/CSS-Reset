        <h3>An Advanced Reset for Modern Styles</h3>
        <p>Built with the wonderful help of Kevin Powell (YouTube @KevinPowell, unaffiliated). An advanced reset that overrides browser defaults and applies a simple, basic styling template that I like to kick things off with to help me move a little faster in the early stages of the styling process. Global color variables are set up with a basic earthtone by default and can easily be built to your preferences with a few simple keystrokes. Global typography scale is pre-built to adapt to screen-size and is based on a 16px base value (--fs-400). This reset is mobile responsive out of the box, with support for both light and dark user color scheme preferences, and aims to set the developer up for a smoother, less convulted journey through the process of styling their site. Open-license, free-to-use.</p>
